- 👋 Hi, I’m Shaffi Koya. I am a physician from India with several years of global health systems and policy experience. 
- 👀 I’m interested in infectious diseases, health security and regulations, antibiotic resistance, and determinants of health.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about health inequities around caste discrimination and forced displacement.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on quasi-experimental research to study effects of various government policies on health inequities.
